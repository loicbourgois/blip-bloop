### Plant protein making

Protein is made from nitrate, a form of nitrogen that has been fixed by microorganisms. Plants cannot use nitrogen directly, so they rely on bacteria to convert the nitrogen into a form they can use. These bacteria reside near the roots of the plants or in special structures on the roots called nodules. The bacteria in nodules have formed a symbiotic relationship with the plants where they exchange usable nitrogen for sugar from the plant.
